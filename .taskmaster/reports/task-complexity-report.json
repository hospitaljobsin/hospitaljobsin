Implement specific logging or integrate with APM to track key metrics: number of database queries, number of LLM API calls, and processing time for distinct stages of the filtering process per request. 4. Analyze collected performance data, compare new metrics against baselines/goals (e.g., >50% latency reduction, N to 1 LLM calls), document findings, and identify any remaining bottlenecks.",
