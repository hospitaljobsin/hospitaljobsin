			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for: 1. Defining the `AIApplicantMatchType(graphene.Enum)` with specified values. 2. Defining the `AIApplicantInsight(graphene.ObjectType)` with specified fields. 3. Adding the `ai_insight` field to `JobApplicantType` and implementing its `resolve_ai_insight` resolver.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity as it's primarily schema definition in Python/Graphene with clear specifications. The three main steps in details map directly to subtasks."

			"taskTitle": "Enhance CrewAI `ProfileAnalyzerTool` Output Structure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for: 1. Modifying the `ProfileAnalyzerTool`'s `_run` method to return the specified structured dictionary. 2. Ensuring the `filter_job/crew.py` correctly processes this new structured output from the tool. 3. Implementing unit tests for the `ProfileAnalyzerTool` to verify the new output structure and content, including edge cases.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity. Involves changing the output contract of an AI tool and ensuring its consumer (the crew) adapts. Testing is crucial for AI component changes."

			"taskTitle": "Modify `Job.applicants` GraphQL Resolver for AI Search (Initial Setup)",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks for: 1. Updating the `JobType.resolve_applicants` signature to include `searchTerm=None` and implementing the `if searchTerm:` conditional block. 2. Adding tests to verify the `searchTerm` is received and the correct code path is taken, while also ensuring existing status filtering remains functional when `searchTerm` is not provided.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity, involves adding a parameter and a conditional branch to an existing resolver. Key is ensuring no regressions to existing functionality."
